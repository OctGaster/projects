Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a tic-tac-toe game, which allows human user to play against computer. The turn order is chosen randomly, and first step is always made by 'X's. In order to make step, user have to input pair of coordinates of cell on the game field, where the user's mark ('X' or 'O') should be put. These coordinates are numbers from 1 to 3.

When computer makes its step, it uses the following algorithm.
 -- Game field is interpreted as a 9D vector, where 'X's correspond to 1, 'O' to -1 and free cells are represented as zeros.
 -- All winning combinations of symbols are also encoded as 9D vectors, with ones in places of some symbol (either 'X' or 'O') and zeros in the other places.
 -- Proximity of the current game field vector to any winning pattern is measured by calculating cosine between the corresponding vectors.
 -- In order to decide, where to put the next symbol, computer calculates cosines between current game field vector and all winning patterns of 'X's and 'O's.
 -- Then, machine finds two cosines, which are the smallest in both groups of winning templates (regardless of sign), and compares them.
 -- If it finds that current game situation is about to computer's victory, it complements the combination of own symbols to the winning one.
 -- Otherwise, if user is closer to victory, machine tries not allow him to win, and puts own symbol in the place of user's winning combination.
