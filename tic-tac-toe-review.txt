Tic-Tac-Toe

    This project is a tic-tac-toe game. It has two modes -- AI vs. AI match or ordinary game, which allows human user to play against computer. The turn order is then chosen randomly, and first step is always made by 'X's. In order to make step, user have to input pair of coordinates of cell on the game field, where the user's mark ('X' or 'O') should be put. These coordinates are numbers from 1 to 3.
